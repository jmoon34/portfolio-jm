Based on the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/awesome-nextjs-with-react-and-node-amazing-portfolio-app/

The goal of this project is to learn the Next.js framework, as well as other stanardized practices for web development such as implementing OAuth by using a third-party application like Auth0. 

After completing the tutorial, I am planning on customizing the CSS to my liking, as well as actually using it as a personal website where I can showcase my work and CV.
